## Enochian, per Wikipedia

**Enochian** (/ɪˈnoʊkiən/ *ə-NOH-kee-ən*)
is an occult [constructed
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language "Constructed language")
--- said by its originators to have been received from angels ---
recorded in the private journals of [John
Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee "John Dee") and his
colleague [Edward
Kelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley "Edward Kelley") in
late 16th-century England. Kelley was a
[scryer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scryer "Scryer")
who worked with Dee in his
[magical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_magic "Renaissance magic")
investigations. The language is integral to the practice of [Enochian
magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian_magic "Enochian magic").

The language found in Dee\'s and Kelley\'s journals encompasses a
limited [textual
corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus "Text corpus").
Linguist [Donald
Laycock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Laycock "Donald Laycock"),
an [Australian
Skeptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Skeptics "Australian Skeptics"),
studied the Enochian journals, and argues against any extraordinary
features. The untranslated texts of the *Liber Loagaeth* manuscript
recall the patterns of
[glossolalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossolalia "Glossolalia")
rather than true language. Dee did not distinguish the *Liber Loagaeth*
material from the translated language of the *Calls*, which is more like
an artificial language. This language was called **Angelical** by Dee
and later came to be referred to as \'Enochian\' by subsequent writers.
The [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology") and
[grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar") resemble
English, though the translations are not sufficient to work out any
regular
[morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics) "Morphology (linguistics)").
Some Enochian words resemble words and proper names in the Bible, but
most have no apparent etymology.

Dee\'s journals also refer to this language as \"**Celestial Speech**\",
\"**First Language of God-Christ**\", \"**Holy Language**\", or
\"**Language of Angels**\". He also referred to it as
\"**[Adamical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamic_language "Adamic language")**\"
because, according to Dee\'s angels, it was used by
[Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam "Adam") in Paradise to name
all things. The term \"Enochian\" comes from Dee\'s assertion that the
Biblical patriarch [Enoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch "Enoch")
had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.
